"""Cross-validation for the federation entry point (CDF M5 WP-C2).

Two layers, both against pyoxigraph as the W3C ground truth:

1. **Seeded-partition parity** — a partition with ``seed_bindings``
   must produce exactly the bindings pyoxigraph produces for the same
   query with the same ``VALUES`` rows.
2. **Two-leg federation** — the M5 execution model in miniature:
   leg 1 selects canonical keys, its result rows (in SPARQL-JSON
   binding shape, exactly what an engine would hold) seed leg 2, and
   the engine-side hash-join of the two legs must equal pyoxigraph
   evaluating the *un-partitioned* conceptual query over the whole
   dataset. This is the property federation correctness rests on:
   partition + push down + join == evaluate whole.
