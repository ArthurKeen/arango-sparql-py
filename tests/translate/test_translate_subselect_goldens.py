"""Golden tests for SPARQL 1.1 sub-SELECT + VALUES (``ToMultiSet``).

The corpus lives in :mod:`subselect.yml` next to this file — all
cases run against an empty resolver (default-collection fallback),
which is the configuration the W3C analyzer drives.

Three independent blocks of tests:

* **Supported goldens** — sub-SELECT (with / without LIMIT / ORDER /
  DISTINCT / aggregates / shared-variable join semantics) and
  VALUES (single-var, multi-var, UNDEF, standalone, integer
  literals). Each pins the exact AQL string and bind-vars dict so
  alias-numbering / bind-name / clause-ordering regressions surface
  loudly.

* **Resolver-driven interactions** — tests that need a populated
  resolver to exercise (PG-class-bound subject in a sub-SELECT,
  child-builder counter seeding across multiple sub-SELECTs in one
  query). These live in Python rather than YAML because they need
  richer setup than the YAML harness's single ``ontology`` field.

This slice bumped W3C query-evaluation coverage from 27.3 % to
32.8 % (+5.5 pp, +14 newly-passing tests across the ``ToMultiSet``
and ``values`` algebra buckets combined).
