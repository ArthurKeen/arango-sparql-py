"""Example SPARQL-specific postconditions for the NL→SPARQL retry loop.

The postcondition *mechanism* is language-agnostic and lives in the shared
engine (:mod:`arango_query_core.nl.postconditions`): a caller-supplied semantic
invariant that rides the generate→validate→retry budget, is announced to the
model up front, feeds its correction back on violation, and fails closed when
the budget is spent. See that module for the ``Postcondition`` protocol and the
runner.

This module ships two *illustrative* SPARQL invariants a caller can pass into
:func:`arango_sparql.nl2sparql.nl_to_sparql` (or model their own domain checks
on). They catch the class of bug neither parse nor translate can: a query that
is well-formed and maps to valid AQL yet is **semantically wrong**.

Both inspect the rdflib algebra (hard rule #1 — never a hand-rolled parser) via
:func:`arango_sparql.translate.parser.parse_sparql`, and both are scoped to
``SELECT`` queries; ``ASK`` / ``CONSTRUCT`` / ``DESCRIBE`` have no row
projection to reason about, so the checks accept them untouched. A parse failure
inside a check returns ``None`` (accept) rather than raising: the engine only
runs postconditions on queries the ``validate`` seam already parsed and
translated, so a parse error here would mean disagreement with the authority,
and failing the query closed on it would be a false outage.
