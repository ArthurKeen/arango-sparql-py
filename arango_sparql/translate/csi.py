"""CSI v1 (Conceptual Schema Interchange) → :class:`MappingBundle` adapter.

``CSI v1`` is the cross-tool interchange for a conceptual model plus its
ArangoDB physical mapping. A *forward* producer (e.g. r2g) emits it from a
relational→graph migration config; the *reverse* producer is
``arango-schema-analyzer``. Both write the same three-block contract:
``{conceptualModel, arangoPhysicalMapping, provenance}``.

This adapter lets the SPARQL→AQL translator consume a CSI document directly:
it maps the CSI physical block onto the bundle's ``physicalMapping`` (which is
already almost the same shape — collection/edge names + optional type
discriminators) and enriches each relationship spec with the ``fromEntity`` /
``toEntity`` endpoints declared in the CSI conceptual model. The CSI conceptual
model becomes the bundle's ``conceptualSchema`` (the human/LLM view), and the
CSI provenance is preserved verbatim under ``metadata["csiProvenance"]``.

See contextual-data-fabric ADR-0001 / M5 implementation-plan WP-A3, and the
forward producer in r2g (``src/r2g/csi.py``).

Versions: ``"1"`` and ``"1.1"``. 1.1 adds ``path`` to a property mapping (a
value inside a nested object, issue #72) and is written only by a document
that uses it. Property mappings are strict in both versions: a key this
reader does not know is refused, since it could change where a value is read.
