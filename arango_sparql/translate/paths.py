"""Property-path expansion (SPARQL 1.1 §9 / §18.4).

The Algebra visitor's main triple dispatcher
(:meth:`arango_sparql.translate.visitor.AlgebraVisitor._emit_triple`)
treats the ``predicate`` slot of an rdflib triple as either
``URIRef`` (the common ``?s :name ?n`` shape) or ``Variable`` (the
``?s ?p ?o`` cross-collection-UNION case). Property paths
(``rdflib.paths.Path`` instances — ``SequencePath`` / ``InvPath`` /
``AlternativePath`` / ``MulPath`` / ``NegatedPath``) need a separate,
recursive expansion pass before they can reach the main dispatch
table.

Unlike most of the translation work in this package, property paths
are **not** ported from the legacy ``arango-sparql`` Foxx service.
That project's ``pgt-translator.js`` / ``rpt-translator.js`` files
never branch on path types — the legacy translator silently rejects
any predicate that isn't a fixed IRI. So this module is a
green-field implementation against the W3C SPARQL 1.1 spec (§18.4
"SPARQL Algebra", "Property Paths"), cross-validated against
``pyoxigraph`` as the reference triplestore via ``tests/cross/``.
Because there is no legacy code to mirror, every non-obvious
rewriting choice is documented inline so future readers can match
the spec line-by-line.

Slices land incrementally; this module currently implements the two
that are pure desugarings (no new builder or resolver work):

* :func:`emit_path_triple` — public dispatcher; called from
  :meth:`AlgebraVisitor._emit_triple` when the predicate slot is a
  ``Path`` instance.
* :func:`_emit_sequence_path` — ``?s :p/:q/.../:pN ?o`` expands to
  N triples joined by N-1 fresh intermediate variables, each of
  which is re-dispatched through ``_emit_triple`` so PG / LPG /
  default-collection branches all compose naturally.
* :func:`_emit_inverse_path` — ``?s ^path ?o`` swaps subject and
  object and recurses on the inner path (which may itself be a
  ``Path``, e.g. ``^(:p/:q)`` is an inverse-of-sequence).

All five rdflib path operators (``SequencePath`` / ``InvPath`` /
``AlternativePath`` / ``MulPath`` / ``NegatedPath``) have a
dedicated expander below. The remaining gap is inverse arms inside
``NegatedPath`` (``!(^:p)`` — see :func:`_emit_negated_path`) and
property paths over RPT-mapped subjects; both surface stable,
greppable ``UnsupportedSparqlError`` messages so the W3C XFAIL
bucket stays clean.

Intermediate variables minted by sequence expansion use the sigil
``_path_<n>`` so they cannot collide with user-supplied variable
names (every variable that's ever shown in projection / SELECT
output came from the user, and ``_path_*`` is never emitted into a
projection). rdflib's ``Variable`` accepts leading underscores at
construction; the existing visitor never minted underscore-prefixed
variables before this commit so the sigil is private by
construction.
