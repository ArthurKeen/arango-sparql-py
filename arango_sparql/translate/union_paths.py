"""SPARQL 1.1 ``UNION`` and ``AlternativePath`` (``:p|:q``) emission.

Both constructs lower to the same AQL recipe: translate each arm in
its own child builder, project every arm's result to the common
union-schema (vars not bound in an arm get ``null``), then iterate
the combined arms with ``FOR <row> IN UNION((arm1), (arm2), …)``.
Each row of the UNION carries a uniform ``{var: value, ...}`` shape
so the outer scope can reference any variable from the union schema
via ``row.<var>`` regardless of which arm produced the row.

Why share the recipe:

* SPARQL ``AlternativePath`` is defined in §18.4 as the union of
  per-arm single-triple BGP solutions — the rewrite is literal:
  ``?s (:p|:q) ?o ≡ UNION({?s :p ?o}, {?s :q ?o})``. Emitting it
  through the same helper as ``Union`` keeps the two cases
  semantically and operationally aligned.
* AQL's ``UNION`` takes N array expressions and returns their
  concatenation. Each arm's child-builder block, wrapped in
  parentheses, is exactly such an expression.

Two-phase translation:

1. **Probe** every arm in a throwaway child to discover which
   variables it binds. Throwaway because we need the *union* of
   per-arm vars BEFORE we can decide each arm's RETURN schema. The
   probe uses :meth:`AqlQueryBuilder.create_child` but never calls
   :meth:`absorb_child`, so the parent's counters don't advance —
   the second-phase children re-spawn with the same seeded
   counters and mint the same aliases (which is harmless because
   the first-phase counterparts were discarded).
2. **Emit** every arm a second time, this time projecting the
   full union schema (each arm RETURNs ``{v1: expr_or_null,
   v2: expr_or_null, …}``). Absorb each into the parent in order;
   the parent's counters advance per absorption so the second
   arm's aliases are disjoint from the first's. Finally emit
   ``FOR <row> IN UNION((arm1_aql), (arm2_aql), …)`` in the
   outer scope and bind ``row.<var>`` into ``var_to_expr`` (with
   equality FILTERs for shared variables, matching the
   ``ToMultiSet`` / ``MINUS`` recipe).

Outer scope variable pre-seeding: each child receives a copy of
the outer's ``var_to_expr`` so a UNION nested inside a BGP that
has outer-bound ``?s`` joins each arm's local ``?s`` to the
outer's expression (via the BGP emitter's existing shared-variable
FILTER recipe). This mirrors how :mod:`minus_exists` propagates
the outer scope into MINUS / EXISTS probes.

Legacy reference: ``references/arango-sparql/src/lib/
pgt-translator.js`` has no ``visit_Union`` and no
``AlternativePath`` handler — both return ``UnsupportedSparqlError``
in the legacy Foxx service. This module is a green-field
implementation against the SPARQL 1.1 spec (§18.5 ``Union``,
§18.4 property paths), cross-validated against pyoxigraph via
``tests/cross/`` once the W3C harness lands the live-execution
runs.

    """Spawn a child visitor with outer-scope binding & scope state
    pre-seeded.

    Pre-seeding plays the same role as in
    :mod:`minus_exists`: a UNION arm that references an
    outer-bound variable should turn it into an equality FILTER
    against the outer's expression, not anchor a new FOR. The
    BGP emitter's ``_bind_subject`` does the right thing as long
    as ``var_to_expr`` has the outer's binding when the inner
    triple is visited.

    **Scope-stack propagation** — beyond ``var_to_expr`` we also
    carry forward four pieces of ambient state so the child
    behaves identically to the outer scope it was spawned from:

    * ``graph_scope`` — the active SPARQL named-graph stack. When
      a ``GRAPH ?g { … }`` wrapper opens a UNION (e.g. the path
      pattern in W3C ``property-path/pp35``), each child arm's
      ``_open_collection`` calls must see the ``?g`` term on the
      stack so ``_apply_graph_scope`` can both attach the
      ``alias.<graph_field>`` filter AND bind the graph variable
      into the child's ``var_to_expr``. The standard UNION-emitter
      re-projection then promotes that binding to the outer's
      ``row.<g>`` expression for the surrounding FILTER. Forgetting
      to propagate this stack used to fail pp35 with the misleading
      ``FILTER references unbound variable ?g`` diagnostic — the
      variable was perfectly well-scoped at the SPARQL level; the
      visitor just dropped it on UNION descent.

    * ``var_to_rpt_class`` — an outer-scope RPT type pattern (``?s
      a :Person``) binds ``?s`` to a ``ResolvedClass`` in this map;
      a UNION arm that references the same ``?s`` must continue to
      route through the RPT reader, not the PG/LPG emitter. Same
      copy-on-spawn discipline as ``var_to_expr``.

    * ``tenant_entity`` / ``tenant_bind_placeholder`` — the
      per-query tenant commitment and its cached AQL bind variable
      (PRD §6.5.1). A UNION arm that opens a tenant-scoped class
      must apply the SAME tenant filter, not mint a fresh one, so
      EXPLAIN output stays clean and cross-tenant-join detection
      stays consistent. Propagating both the commitment and the
      cached placeholder is what keeps the per-query tenant bind
      a single AQL parameter no matter how many UNION arms touch
      tenant-scoped collections.

    The two counters on ``BindingState`` (``path_var_counter`` and
    ``bgp_counter``) are deliberately NOT propagated — they mint
    internal sigil names (``_path_<n>`` / ``_bn_<bgp>_<label>``)
    whose scope is intra-arm, and resetting them per child gives
    deterministic per-arm AQL even when arms re-enter the same
    visitor code path.

    Counter sharing follows the standard
    :meth:`AqlQueryBuilder.create_child` /
    :meth:`absorb_child` protocol — caller is responsible for
    either absorbing the child or discarding it (probe phase).
