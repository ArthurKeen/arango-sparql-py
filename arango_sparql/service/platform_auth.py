"""Platform sessions — connect as the user the ArangoDB platform already
signed in, instead of asking for a URL, username and password.

Deployed on the Arango Platform (Container Manager / BYOC), every request to
the service passes through the platform gateway, which authenticates the
browser's platform login and forwards the caller's platform JWT as
``Authorization: Bearer <jwt>``. The operator also injects the coordinator's
in-cluster address as ``ARANGO_DEPLOYMENT_ENDPOINT``. Together they let the
Workbench open a session as the logged-in user with no stored credential and
no login form — the user only picks a database and a graph.

This module never decides who the caller is: the coordinator validates the
JWT on the session's first call, so a forged or expired token is refused by
ArangoDB itself, and the session can see exactly what the user's platform
permissions allow.

``ARANGO_SPARQL_PLATFORM_AUTH=off`` disables the path entirely (the manual
connect dialog still works).

TLS to the operator endpoint: it serves a certificate from the cluster's own
CA, which the container does not trust by default, so a verifying client fails
with a bare "Can't connect to host(s)" (seen on prod.demo). See
:func:`platform_tls_verify` for the policy and its overrides.

Mirror of ``arango_cypher.service.platform_auth`` with the standard
``ARANGO_CYPHER_*`` → ``ARANGO_SPARQL_*`` env-var renames
(``ARANGO_DEPLOYMENT_ENDPOINT``, ``ARANGO_URL``, ``ARANGO_DB`` and
``ROOT_PATH`` are operator-injected / shared across the sister projects, so
they keep their canonical names).
